## 7. Tech Hacks for Automating Repetitive Design Tasks

Automation is the secret weapon of efficient designers. By letting technology handle the mundane, you free up creative energy for higher-impact work. Here are practical tech hacks to automate repetitive tasks in your design workflow:

### Design Tool Automation

- **Figma Plugins**: Use plugins for auto-layout components, icon insertion, and batch color changes.
- **Photoshop Actions**: Record and replay sequences for effects, resizing, or exporting assets.
- **Sketch Runner**: Launch commands and apply styles instantly via keyboard shortcuts.

### Code & Asset Generation

- **SVG Optimizers**: Automatically compress and clean up SVG files with tools like SVGO.
- **Design Token Export**: Extract colors, fonts, and spacing as JSON or CSS variables for dev handoff.
- **Icon Libraries**: Access and insert icons programmatically using Iconjar or similar tools.

### File & Content Management

- **Automated Naming**: Use scripts or apps to rename batches of files consistently.
- **Cloud Sync**: Set up automated backups to Google Drive, Dropbox, or GitHub.
- **Content Filling**: Populate mockups with real data using plugins or placeholder APIs.

### Communication & Workflow

- **Email Templates**: Save responses for common client queries to reduce typing time.
- **Calendar Scheduling**: Use Calendly or similar tools for hassle-free client meetings.
- **Project Automation**: Integrate Zapier or IFTTT to connect your design tools with project management apps.

### Developer Handoff

- **Style Guide Generators**: Automatically create living style guides from your design files.
- **Code Export**: Extract CSS, React components, or even Storybook stories directly from your designs.

By integrating even a few of these automation hacks, your design process will become faster, less error-prone, and far more enjoyableâ€”leaving you with more time to focus on creativity and innovation.
